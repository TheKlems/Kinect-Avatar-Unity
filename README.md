# KinectAvatarForUnity
In this project, I will attempt to represent a body with spheres in Unity, using a Kinect. All of this is made from scratch.

# Installing the Kinect plugin for Unity :
1) Expand the .Zip file, and move Kinect.2.0.1410.19000.UnityPackageto a well known <location>
2) Open UnityPro (you need to have a Pro edition to pull in custom packages and plugins) (For my project I don't use UnityPro)
3) Create a new project
4) Click on the menu item Assets->Import Package->Custom Package...
5) Navigate to the <location> from step 1
6) Select the Kinect.2.0.1410.19000.UnityPackage
7) Click "Open"
8) Click "Import" in the lower right hand corner of the "Importing Package" Dialog (which Unity will launch after step 7)
9) If you wish to see the Kinect in action there are two sample scenes available from the zip.
