# KinectAvatarForUnity
In this project, I will attempt to represent a body with spheres in Unity, using a Kinect. All of this is made from scratch.

# Installing the Kinect plugin for Unity :
- Expand the .Zip file, and move Kinect.2.0.1410.19000.UnityPackageto a well known <location>
- Open UnityPro (you need to have a Pro edition to pull in custom packages and plugins) (For my project I don't use UnityPro)
- Create a new project
- Click on the menu item Assets->Import Package->Custom Package...
- Navigate to the <location> from step 1
- Select the Kinect.2.0.1410.19000.UnityPackage
- Click "Open"
- Click "Import" in the lower right hand corner of the "Importing Package" Dialog (which Unity will launch after step 7)
- If you wish to see the Kinect in action there are two sample scenes available from the zip.
